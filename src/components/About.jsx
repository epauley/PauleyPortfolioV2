        <p>Welcome to my little section of the web!</p>
        <p>
          By day, I&apos;m a developer with a solid background in front-end
          development. Experienced on various platforms such as Drupal and
          Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Skilled in overseeing and reviewing
          changes, collaborating with agency teams, and leading technical
          initiatives.

          At night, I&apos;m most likely planning a trip somewhere in the world,
          putting off watering my thirsty plants, or chilling in front of the TV
          playing video games.
